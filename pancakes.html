<h2>How to Make Pancakes</h2>
<p>Below, you'll discover a comprehensive list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions, but first, let's cover the fundamentals:</p>


<h3>Pancake Ingredients</h3>
<p>You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>Flour: This homemade pancake recipe begins with the use of all-purpose flour.</ul>
    <ul> Baking Powder: Baking powder, a leavening agent, is the key to achieving light and fluffy pancakes.</ul>
    <ul>Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is sufficient to impart a subtle sweetness to the pancakes.</ul>
    <ul>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor without imparting a salty taste to your pancakes.</ul>
    <ul>Milk and Butter: The combination of milk and butter adds both moisture and richness to the pancake batter.</ul>
    <ul>Egg: Incorporating a whole egg not only adds moisture but also aids in binding the pancake batter together.</ul>

<h3>Creating Homemade Pancakes from Scratch:</h3>
<p>Making your own pancakes is simple; all you need is a good recipe. 
    We can help with that! Below is the detailed recipe, but first, here's a quick rundown of what to expect:</p>
        <ol>Begin by sifting the dry ingredients together.</ol>
        <ol>Create a well in the mixture and incorporate the wet ingredients, stirring until thoroughly mixed.</ol>
        <ol> Use a scoop to place the batter onto a preheated griddle or pan.</ol>
        <ol>Allow it to cook for two to three minutes before flipping.</ol>
        <ol> Keep cooking until both sides turn into a golden brown hue.</ol>

<p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. 
    This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.</p>
